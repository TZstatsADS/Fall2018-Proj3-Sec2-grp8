Project 3 Image Super Resolution

Team members: Xiaojing Dong, Lujia Wang, Huiming Xie, Kayla Smith, Deepika Namboothiri

Summary: In this project, we developed a baseline model and a improved model for image super resolution.  

[Contribution Statement] All team members participated in group meetings and online discussions. 


Xiaojing Dong, and Lujia Wang together completed the baseline model (including feature extraction and recovering high resolution images), developed the XGBoost model with utilizing label information, and performed key point detection. Xiaojing carried out the computation on the full training set, generated the main reports and modified the main.Rmd to utilize the label information. Lujia carried out the computation on a subset of training set and tested on the rest to evaluate the model performance, generated the main reports, and prepared the presentation. 


Huiming Xie tried out different deep learning methods (including SRCNN and FSRCNN), as well as a similar method to the baseline model with GBM substituted by SVM and compared the MSE and running time; after concluding that the algorithms does not beat the baseline model, focused on modifying the baseline model by incorporating the extra label information to wrap up the model together. Deepika Namboothiri did other research work on different models and tried out the deep learning method GANs with python for super resolution; after comparing the MSE with baseline, it turned out that the baseline worked better. Kayla Smith contacted the author of some research paper to consult the algorithm, looked into the SVM model and made modification to main.Rmd to incorporate the extra label information.
