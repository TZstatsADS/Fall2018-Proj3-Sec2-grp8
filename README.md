+ Project summary: In this project, we created two predictive models to enhance blurry and low resolution images. Our models can generate high resolution color images with good quality in a short time. Therefore they are good choices for mobile AI programs. The baseline model implements the Boosted Decision Stumps using `gbm` package in R and the improved model implements the Gradient Boosting using `XGBoost` package in R. We trained two models on 1500 images. The detailed reports for both model are under [doc](doc/) folder.
